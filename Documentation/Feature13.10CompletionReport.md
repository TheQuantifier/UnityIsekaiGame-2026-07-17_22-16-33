# Feature 13.10 Completion Report

## 1. Summary
Implemented crimes, reporting, warrants, and wanted status as an authoritative Step 13 runtime for potential legal offenses without treating reports, suspicions, warrants, or wanted status as guilt.

## 2. Current Branch
`feature/13.10-crimes-reporting-warrants-wanted-status`.

## 3. Existing Architecture Inspected
Inspected Step 13 government, law, authority, diplomacy, organization, persistence, Test Lab, fixture, command automation, and definition-registry patterns before integration.

## 4. Existing Architecture Reused
Reused `DefinitionRegistry`, Step 13.8 jurisdiction/government records, Step 13.9 legal applicability, Step 13.3 authority concepts, shared persistence participants, Test Lab fixture ownership, immutable clone patterns, and command-line automation reporting.

## 5. Event, Incident, Report, Allegation, Suspect, Warrant, and Wanted Separation
Crime records reference historical events and legal context but keep incident, report, allegation, suspect, warrant, and wanted records as separate lifecycle-owned entities.

## 6. Offense Definition Architecture
Added `LegalOffenseDefinition` for offense category, severity, legal action, legal provision effects, elements, supported stages, participation, and thresholds.

## 7. Production Offense Definitions
Added prototype offense definitions for violence, killing placeholder, threat, theft, property damage, entry, fraud, office misuse, confidentiality breach, military violation, regulatory violation, attempt, and assistance.

## 8. Offense Elements
Added structured offense elements with kind, key, expected value, required flag, and negation support.

## 9. Mental-State and Attempt Boundaries
Offense definitions record mental-state policy and supported attempt/completion stages without implementing court judgment or guilt.

## 10. Stable Potential-Offense Identity
Potential offense records require stable IDs and preserve incident, actor, target, law, provision, jurisdiction, and evidence state.

## 11. Potential-Offense Evaluation and Status
Evaluation produces explicit statuses such as elements supported, lawful, exempt, immune, insufficient evidence, or no applicable law.

## 12. Historical Law Evaluation
Potential-offense evaluation calls `LegalRuntime.Evaluate` at the incident occurrence time and stores the resolved legal provision/version reference.

## 13. Stable Incident Identity
Crime incidents use stable incident IDs and preserve event, place, territory, jurisdiction, victim, witness, report, offense, and visibility metadata.

## 14. Incident Record and Lifecycle
Incident records include lifecycle state and are updated only through runtime-owned requests.

## 15. Incident Creation Sources
Incident requests support reported, official, observed, rumor-derived, and system-source categories through explicit category and provenance fields.

## 16. Historical Event Integration
Incidents store historical event IDs as references rather than duplicating Step 8 event ownership.

## 17. Stable Crime Report Identity
Reports require stable report IDs and link to a specific incident, reporter, report category, source, and submitted time.

## 18. Report Categories and Lifecycle
Report records support victim, witness, official, organization, property-owner, anonymous, self, audit, third-party, rumor, and automated placeholder categories.

## 19. False, Mistaken, and Withdrawn Reports
Report lifecycle values can represent rejected, withdrawn, merged, mistaken, malicious, or unsubstantiated claims without deleting the original report.

## 20. Reporter Reliability Integration
Reports carry reporter reliability basis points and provenance IDs for Step 8/source integration without creating truth by assertion.

## 21. Stable Allegation Identity
Allegations have stable IDs and link reports to claimed offense, actor, victim, conduct, and sufficiency.

## 22. Allegation Lifecycle
Allegation state is independent from report and offense state, allowing rejected allegations to preserve the original report.

## 23. Unknown Offender Support
Incidents and allegations can exist before a suspect or known actor is recorded.

## 24. Victim Association Architecture
Victim IDs are stored on incidents and allegations as explicit associations rather than Person-owned crime mutations.

## 25. Witness Association Architecture
Witness IDs are stored on incidents as explicit references suitable for future testimony and evidence systems.

## 26. Stable Suspect Identity
Suspect records use stable IDs and link subject, incident, offense, participation, basis, confidence, and lifecycle state.

## 27. Suspect Lifecycle and Suspicion Basis
Suspect records support explicit suspicion basis and lifecycle transitions without equating suspicion with guilt.

## 28. Suspect Clearing and Misidentification
Suspects can transition to misidentified/cleared states while preserving the investigative record.

## 29. Evidence-Link Architecture
Evidence links store stable evidence IDs, source IDs, report/offense references, relevance, sufficiency, and world time.

## 30. Evidence Sufficiency Boundary
Evidence sufficiency gates potential-offense, warrant, and status decisions without replacing Step 8 evidence ownership.

## 31. Investigation Record Foundation
Investigation records track responsible government, organization, reviewers, incident, opened time, and visibility.

## 32. Jurisdiction Integration
Incidents, offenses, warrants, and wanted statuses carry government, jurisdiction, territory, and scope references.

## 33. Multi-Jurisdiction Incidents
Records support multiple jurisdiction IDs on incidents and warrant scopes.

## 34. Feature 13.9 Legal-Applicability Integration
Crime evaluation delegates law status to `LegalRuntime` and stores legal applicability results instead of duplicating law rules.

## 35. Exemption and Immunity Integration
Potential-offense status records exemption and immunity outcomes from legal applicability.

## 36. Feature 13.3 Authority Integration
Warrant review and issuance enforce explicit authority or trusted-system paths.

## 37. Report Submission Authority
Ordinary report submission remains allowed without requiring law-enforcement authority.

## 38. Warrant Definition Architecture
Added `WarrantDefinition` for category, allowed scopes, minimum threshold, required institutional action, active-offense requirement, and derived wanted behavior.

## 39. Production Warrant Definitions
Added prototype arrest, search, seizure, and questioning warrant definitions.

## 40. Stable Warrant Request Identity
Warrant requests require stable IDs and preserve incident, potential offense, requester, government, organization, scope, threshold, and lifecycle.

## 41. Warrant Request Lifecycle
Request lifecycle covers pending, approved, denied, withdrawn, superseded, and issued states.

## 42. Warrant-Issuance Threshold
Warrant requests validate asserted sufficiency against both warrant and offense thresholds.

## 43. Stable Warrant Identity
Issued warrants use stable warrant IDs and preserve request, subject, scope, issuer, activation, expiration, and lifecycle.

## 44. Warrant Target and Scope Architecture
Warrant scopes support person, place, property, item, inventory, record, action, territory, jurisdiction, and purpose references.

## 45. Warrant Lifecycle
Warrants can be active, expired, suspended, withdrawn, quashed, satisfied, or superseded.

## 46. Warrant Suspension, Withdrawal, Renewal, and Supersession
Lifecycle transitions preserve original warrant identity and history instead of replacing records destructively.

## 47. Warrant Satisfaction Boundary
The runtime can mark satisfaction state but does not execute arrest, search, seizure, or detention.

## 48. Warrant Execution Boundary
Physical enforcement is explicitly deferred to later arrest/court/enforcement systems.

## 49. Warrant Review Architecture
Warrant request review is a separate recordable decision before issuance.

## 50. Wanted-Status Definition Architecture
Added `WantedStatusDefinition` for purpose, visibility permissions, and derivation from warrant.

## 51. Wanted Purpose Categories
Supports arrest, questioning, locate, missing person, military apprehension, internal process, and custom purposes.

## 52. Stable Wanted-Status Identity
Wanted statuses require stable IDs and preserve definition, subject, incident, warrant, jurisdiction, territory, risk, lifecycle, and visibility.

## 53. Wanted-Status Lifecycle
Wanted status can be active, suspended, expired, cleared, mistaken, withdrawn, or superseded.

## 54. Derived and Materialized Wanted State
Issuing a configured warrant can materialize a derived wanted status that expires with the warrant.

## 55. Jurisdiction-Scoped Wanted Status
Wanted records store jurisdiction and territory scope and do not imply global hostility or guilt.

## 56. Cross-Jurisdiction Warrant Recognition
Records can preserve cross-jurisdiction references without implementing extradition or transfer.

## 57. Wanted Notice Architecture
Wanted notices are separate publishable records linked to wanted statuses.

## 58. Erroneous Wanted Status and Correction
Wanted statuses can be corrected or cleared while preserving the erroneous historical status.

## 59. Danger-Assessment Boundary
Wanted risk is explicit and separate from the mere existence of a warrant.

## 60. Bounty Boundary
Bounty/payment execution is not implemented in Feature 13.10.

## 61. Combat and Injury Integration
Violent offense fixtures use conduct/legal references suitable for Step 6 and Step 7 outcomes without owning combat or injury state.

## 62. Item, Inventory, Property, and Custody Integration
The runtime supports item/property/custody reference fields for theft, seizure, and damage cases without owning item state.

## 63. Financial, Contract, and Office-Misconduct Integration
Prototype offenses cover organization-funds misuse and office misuse while deferring accounting ownership to Steps 11 and 13.4.

## 64. Citizenship and Legal-Status Context
Crime evaluation is compatible with legal status, exemption, immunity, and citizenship context from Feature 13.9.

## 65. Diplomacy, War, and Government-in-Exile Boundaries
The runtime stores government and jurisdiction references without implementing extradition, recognition execution, or war enforcement.

## 66. Knowledge, Belief, Memory, and Rumor Integration
Reports and evidence preserve provenance IDs and source references for Step 8 integration without creating knowledge mutations automatically.

## 67. Relationship, Reputation, and Norm Boundaries
Crime records do not automatically mutate relationships, reputation, norms, moods, or rumors.

## 68. Investigation AI Boundary
Autonomous investigation decisions are not implemented.

## 69. Feature 13.11 Arrest and Court Boundary
Arrest, detention, trial, judgment, guilt, sentencing, appeal, pardon, and punishment remain deferred.

## 70. Mutation Requests, Preview, and Execution
Runtime operations use explicit request objects, preview support where appropriate, transaction IDs, and duplicate handling.

## 71. Cross-Runtime Atomicity
Crime runtime mutates only Feature 13.10-owned records and validates external references before committing.

## 72. Runtime Ownership and Readiness
`CrimeRuntime` is the sole authoritative runtime for incidents, reports, allegations, suspects, evidence links, investigations, warrants, wanted statuses, and notices.

## 73. Queries and Indexes
The runtime exposes sorted immutable query collections and `TryGet` methods for stable IDs.

## 74. Deterministic Ordering
Snapshots and query collections are ordered by stable IDs and world-time fields.

## 75. Immutable Snapshots
Records and save data clone arrays and nested records before returning them.

## 76. Visibility and Knowledge-Safe Views
Projection methods return full or redacted incident/wanted records based on privileged access.

## 77. Post-Commit Events
The runtime records transactions for committed mutations and exposes operation results for future event bus integration.

## 78. Validation Service
Added `CrimeRuntimeValidationService` and static save-data validation for definitions, references, scope, lifecycle, and graph integrity.

## 79. Time and Scheduled Processing
`ProcessWorldTime` expires warrants and derived wanted statuses deterministically using boundary IDs and transaction idempotence.

## 80. Persistence and Restore Ordering
Added `CrimePersistenceParticipant` with dependencies on government and legal participants and optional authority/diplomacy/history/source dependencies.

## 81. Reset and Disposal
`CrimeRuntime.Reset` and `Dispose` clear owned records and transaction state.

## 82. Multiplayer Authority Boundary
Server-authority/network replication is not implemented; records are structured for later authoritative ownership.

## 83. Test Lab Additions
Added Feature 13.10 Test Lab suite registration and crime fixture-owned runtime area.

## 84. Automated Test Lab Suite
Added eight command/in-game-compatible scenarios for readiness, incident/report/offense, allegations/suspects/evidence, warrant authority, wanted notice, projections, time, and persistence.

## 85. Automated Tests Added
Added six edit-mode tests covering definitions, legal applicability, no-partial-mutation rejection, suspect/warrant/wanted lifecycle, projections, and persistence rejection.

## 86. Documentation Updated
Added this completion report.

## 87. Files Created
Created `Assets/_Project/Runtime/Crimes/*`, `CrimePersistenceParticipant.cs`, `CrimesReportingWarrantsWantedStatusTests.cs`, and this documentation file.

## 88. Files Modified
Modified persistence service wiring, Test Lab service definition registration, Test Lab runtime areas, fixture bundle/snapshots, automation validation/host support, Step 13 automation suite registration, and framework tests.

## 89. Validation Commands Run
Commands run: focused Feature 13.10 edit-mode tests, Test Lab automation framework edit-mode tests, and Feature 13.10 command automation suite.

## 90. Exact Test Results
Test runner: 82/82 passed. Automation: passed=8, failed=0, error=0, skipped=0; total=8.

## 91. Tests Not Run and Why
Full Edit Mode and full automation were not run because this feature is not a final Step 13 closeout and focused Feature 13.10 plus automation-framework validation covered the changed surfaces.

## 92. Manual Unity Test Steps
Manual checks should inspect the Test Lab 13.10 tab, run the Feature 13.10 suite in-game, and verify report/warrant/wanted projections in the console and result panel.

## 93. Deferred Scope
Deferred: arrest execution, detention, court process, trial, judgment, guilt, sentencing, punishment, prison, appeal, pardon, patrol AI, investigative AI, search execution, seizure execution, and bounty payment.

## 94. Known Limitations or Follow-Up Concerns
The feature supplies authoritative records and validation; future features should connect richer historical event, Step 8 evidence, item/property, and enforcement workflows through adapters rather than moving ownership into crime runtime.

## 95. Git Status and Confirmation of No Feature 13.10 Git Actions
Feature 13.10 is on `feature/13.10-crimes-reporting-warrants-wanted-status`. No Feature 13.10 files were staged. No Feature 13.10 commit was created. Feature 13.10 was not pushed, merged, rebased, or tagged.
